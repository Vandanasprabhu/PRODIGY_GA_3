# Text Generation with Markov Chains
This repository provides a project for generating random stories using a Markov Model based on the text corpus of Pride and Prejudice. The project involves collecting and cleaning the text data, building a Markov model, and generating stories by predicting the next state in the sequence. The Markov model is trained using n-grams and transition probabilities to generate coherent sequences of words. A random story can be generated by selecting a valid starting state from the model and using it to predict subsequent words. This project is licensed under the MIT License.
